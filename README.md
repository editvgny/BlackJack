# About the project
This is a learning project in Codecool. During the development we learned

The cards are drawn with ASCII characters (black & red like the real ones).
Most of the rules have been validated.

# Rules of Black Jack - 21:
Blackjack (also called "21") is a fun and enjoyable casino card game. The basic rules of blackjack are quite easy to learn.

As the name 21 implies, the object of the game is to come as close to 21 points as possible with your cards -- without going over -- and having a higher total than the dealer.

The game begins with the player placing a bet, then receiving two cards face up. The dealer also receives two cards.

The player wins the amount that was bet if the total value of his cards is closer to 21 than the dealer's cards. Another way to win is if the dealer goes over 21, while the player does not.

The player loses the amount bet if his total goes over 21.
